          description: >-
            Not Found – The server can not find requested resource. In the
            browser, this means the URL is not recognized. In an API, this can
            also mean that the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does
            not exist. Servers may also send this response instead of 403 to
            hide the existence of a resource from an unauthorized client. This
            response code is probably the most famous one due to its frequent
            occurence on the web.
